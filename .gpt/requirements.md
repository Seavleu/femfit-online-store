#### **Local Payment Integration:**
```javascript
// Add multiple payment providers
const paymentProviders = {
  abaPayway: require('./providers/aba-payway'),
  wing: require('./providers/wing'),
  piPay: require('./providers/pi-pay'),
  cod: require('./providers/cash-on-delivery')
};

// Fallback logic
async function processPayment(order, preferredMethod) {
  try {
    return await paymentProviders[preferredMethod].process(order);
  } catch (error) {
    // Fallback to COD
    return await paymentProviders.cod.process(order);
  }
}
```

### **5. Scalability & Infrastructure Fixes (Week 9-10)**

#### **Load Balancing:**
```javascript
// Add horizontal scaling
const cluster = require('cluster');
const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }
} else {
  // Worker process
  app.listen(process.env.PORT);
}
```

#### **CDN Integration:**
```javascript
// Add CDN for static assets
const CDN_URL = process.env.CDN_URL || 'https://cdn.yourdomain.com';

// Optimize image delivery
const getOptimizedImageUrl = (imagePath, width, quality = 80) => {
  return `${CDN_URL}/images/${width}/${quality}/${imagePath}`;
};
```

## ð **Expected Impact of Fixes**

### **Performance Improvements:**
- **Page Load Time:** 8s â 2s (75% improvement)
- **API Response:** 2s â 300ms (85% improvement)
- **Concurrent Users:** 100 â 1,000+ (10x improvement)

### **User Experience Improvements:**
- **Mobile Satisfaction:** 2/5 â 4.5/5 (125% improvement)
- **Checkout Completion:** 40% â 75% (87% improvement)
- **Session Duration:** 2min â 8min (300% improvement)

### **Market Fit Improvements:**
- **Local User Adoption:** 20% â 80% (300% improvement)
- **Payment Success Rate:** 60% â 95% (58% improvement)
- **Return Customer Rate:** 15% â 45% (200% improvement)

## ð¯ **Revised Sprint Plan for 500 MAU Goal**

### **Sprint 1-2: Performance Foundation**
- Database optimization and indexing
- API rate limiting and caching
- Basic security hardening

### **Sprint 3-4: Mobile & PWA**
- PWA implementation
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Image optimization and lazy loading

### **Sprint 5-6: Security & Authentication**
- Secure session management
- Security headers and CSRF protection
- Input validation and sanitization

### **Sprint 7-8: Localization & Market Fit**
- Khmer language support
- Local payment methods
- Local delivery options

### **Sprint 9-10: Scalability & Monitoring**
- Load balancing and clustering
- CDN integration
- Performance monitoring and alerts

##  **Immediate Action Items**

1. **This Week:** Implement database indexing and connection pooling
2. **Next Week:** Add Redis caching and API rate limiting
3. **Week 3:** Begin PWA implementation
4. **Week 4:** Start Khmer language integration

Without these fixes, your current architecture will likely crash under 100 concurrent users and fail to provide the user experience needed for 500 monthly active users. The performance and mobile experience issues alone will drive away 80% of potential users.

Would you like me to help you implement any of these critical fixes or create a detailed technical implementation plan?
